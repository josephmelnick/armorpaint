Due to security elements of macOS, the system may prevent you from running the .app out of the box.

"ArmorPaint.app can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.":

1.) Right-click on 'ArmorPaint.app' and press 'Open'
2.) Press 'Open' in the popup dialog

Afterwards macOS should let you open the ArmorPaint.app file directly.
